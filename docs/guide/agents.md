# Alba for AI Agents

This page is a ready-made prompt for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, Codex and the like) that need
to add Alba integration tests to an ASP.NET Core project. It condenses the setup rules, the scenario API and the
common pitfalls into one block that you can paste into an agent's instructions, a `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` file,
or the start of a conversation.

The complete documentation is also published in agent-friendly form at
[llms.txt](https://jasperfx.github.io/alba/llms.txt) (index) and
[llms-full.txt](https://jasperfx.github.io/alba/llms-full.txt) (every page in one file). Point an agent at those when it
needs more depth than the prompt below.

## The prompt

```md
You are adding Alba integration tests to an ASP.NET Core project. Alba (NuGet package `Alba`, version 9 or later)
runs HTTP requests through the real application in memory using ASP.NET Core's TestServer. There are no sockets and
no HttpClient. Follow these rules exactly; the API below is Alba 9 and differs from older samples you may have seen.

## Project setup
- .NET 10 or later is required. The test project and the application must target `net10.0` or `net11.0`.
- In the test project add a package reference to `Alba` and a project reference to the web project. Alba already
  brings `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing`; do not add it separately.
- Keep the test framework the project already uses (xUnit, NUnit or TUnit). Do not switch frameworks.
- For a Minimal API / top-level statements application, the `Program` type is internal. Add
  `<InternalsVisibleTo Include="<TestProjectName>" />` to the web project's `.csproj` so `AlbaHost.For<Program>` compiles.

## Bootstrapping the host
`AlbaHost` boots the whole application and is expensive. Create it once and share it across tests.

    await using var host = await AlbaHost.For<Program>(x =>
        {
            // ASP.NET Core host customization goes in this action only
            x.UseEnvironment("Testing");
            x.ConfigureServices(s => s.AddSingleton<IExternalService, StubExternalService>());
        })
        // Alba specific setup is chained on the returned builder
        .WithConfiguration("ConnectionStrings:Db", "Host=localhost;Database=test")
        .WithExtension(new AuthenticationStub().WithName("test-user"));

- Every bootstrapping call returns an awaitable `AlbaHostBuilder`. The application starts when it is awaited.
  The builder only exposes `WithConfiguration(...)` and `WithExtension(...)` / `WithExtensions(...)`. Service
  registrations stay inside the `Action<IWebHostBuilder>` passed to `AlbaHost.For<T>`.
- `WithConfiguration` values override `appsettings.json`. On .NET 10 the application must call
  `WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` for them to flow through. Host-level keys like `environment` cannot be set this
  way; use `x.UseEnvironment(...)` instead.
- Extensions can also be passed as arguments: `AlbaHost.For<Program>(new AuthenticationStub())`.
- On .NET 11, `AlbaHost.For<T>` only supports applications built with `WebApplicationBuilder`. For a `Startup.cs`
  style application use `await AlbaHost.For(Program.CreateHostBuilder(args))` or
  `await Program.CreateHostBuilder(args).StartAlbaAsync()`. Both work on every target.
- Bootstrapping is asynchronous only. `new AlbaHost(...)`, `StartAlba()` and `ConfigurationOverride` do not exist
  in Alba 9.

## Sharing the host per test framework
- xUnit: a fixture class implementing `IAsyncLifetime` that awaits `AlbaHost.For<Program>()` in `InitializeAsync`
  and calls `DisposeAsync()` in `DisposeAsync`, consumed through `IClassFixture<T>` or a `[CollectionDefinition]` +
  `ICollectionFixture<T>` for sharing across classes. Test methods must be `async Task`.
- NUnit: a `[SetUpFixture]` class with a static `IAlbaHost Host` property set in `[OneTimeSetUp]` and disposed in
  `[OneTimeTearDown]`.
- TUnit: a class implementing `IAsyncInitializer` and `IAsyncDisposable` that owns the host, injected with
  `[ClassDataSource<AlbaBootstrap>(Shared = SharedType.PerTestSession)]`.

## Writing scenarios
    var result = await host.Scenario(_ =>
    {
        _.Post.Json(new CreateItem("name")).ToUrl("/items");
        _.WithRequestHeader("x-tenant", "acme");
        _.StatusCodeShouldBe(201);
        _.Header("Location").SingleValueShouldMatch(new Regex(@"^/items/\d+$"));
        _.ContentShouldContain("name");
    });
    var item = await result.ReadAsJsonAsync<Item>();

- Verbs: `_.Get`, `_.Put`, `_.Post`, `_.Delete`, `_.Patch`, `_.Head`, `_.Query`, `_.Options`. Set the url with
  `.Url("/path")` for requests without a body, or `.Json(body).ToUrl("/path")` for requests with one.
- Request bodies: `.Json(obj)`, `.RawJson("{...}")`, `.Text("...")`, `.Xml(obj)`, `.FormData(obj)`,
  `_.WriteFormData(dictionary)`, `.ByteArray(bytes)`, `.Stream(stream)`. Set headers with
  `_.WithRequestHeader(name, value)`, `.Accepts("...")`, `.ContentType("...")`.
- Query strings: `_.Get.Url("/search").QueryString("q", "alba")` or `.QueryString(new { q = "alba", page = 2 })`.
- Status codes: the default expectation is any 2xx. `_.StatusCodeShouldBeOk()` requires exactly 200,
  `_.StatusCodeShouldBe(404)` requires that code, `_.IgnoreStatusCode()` skips the check.
- Body assertions: `_.ContentShouldBe("exact")`, `_.ContentShouldContain("part")`, `_.ContentShouldNotContain("part")`,
  `_.ContentTypeShouldBe("application/json")`. Header assertions: `_.Header(name).SingleValueShouldEqual(...)`,
  `.ShouldHaveValues(...)`, `.ShouldNotBeWritten()`, `.SingleValueShouldMatch(regex)`.
  Redirects: `_.RedirectShouldBe("/url")`, `_.RedirectPermanentShouldBe("/url")`.
- Failed assertions throw `ScenarioAssertionException` with the response body in the message. Assert on status and
  headers inside the scenario; assert on deserialized data after it returns.
- Reading the response: `result.ReadAsJsonAsync<T>()`, `ReadAsTextAsync()`, `ReadAsBytesAsync()`, `ReadAsXmlAsync()`,
  `ReadAsServerSentEvents<T>()`. Synchronous variants exist and every read is repeatable. `result.Context` is the raw
  `HttpContext`.
- JSON uses the application's own formatters (System.Text.Json or Newtonsoft). In an application that mixes Minimal
  API and MVC endpoints with customized JSON options, pass `JsonStyle.MinimalApi` or `JsonStyle.Mvc` to `.Json(...)`.
- Shorthands for pure JSON endpoints: `await host.GetAsJson<T>("/url")`, `await host.GetAsText("/url")`,
  `await host.PostJson(body, "/url").Receive<T>()`, `await host.PutJson(body, "/url").Receive<T>()`.
- Alba does not follow redirects, keep cookies between scenarios, or handle anti-forgery tokens. Each scenario is
  one independent request.

## Authentication
- `new AuthenticationStub().With("role", "admin").WithName("alice")` replaces every authentication scheme and
  authenticates each request with those claims. `new AuthenticationStub("SchemeName")` replaces only that scheme.
- `new JwtSecurityStub().With(...)` mints signed bearer tokens from the application's own `JwtBearerOptions` and
  disables OIDC discovery callouts.
- Per scenario: `_.WithClaim(new Claim("color", "green"))`, `_.RemoveClaim("role")`, `_.WithBearerToken(jwt)`.
- Against a real OIDC server: `OpenConnectClientCredentials` or `OpenConnectUserPassword` extensions.

## Hooks and time
- `host.BeforeEach(ctx => ...)` and `host.AfterEach(ctx => ...)` run synchronously around every request with the
  `HttpContext`. `host.BeforeEachAsync(scenario => ...)` runs before the request is built; modify the request with
  `scenario.WithRequestHeader(...)`, `scenario.WithBearerToken(...)` or `scenario.ConfigureHttpContext(...)`.
- `var clock = new TimeProviderOverride(new DateTimeOffset(2030, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, TimeSpan.Zero));` passed to
  `AlbaHost.For<Program>(clock)` replaces the application's `TimeProvider`. Drive it with `clock.Advance(...)` and
  `clock.SetUtcNow(...)`.

## Pitfalls
- If the application does synchronous stream I/O and throws "Synchronous operations are disallowed", set
  `host.Server.AllowSynchronousIO = true` after the host starts.
- Snapshot testing: add Verify and Verify.AspNetCore, then `await Verify(result)` with the scenario result.
- Extend the DSL with extension methods on `Scenario` for repeated setup instead of copying it into every test.

## Deliverable
1. Add the package and project references, plus `InternalsVisibleTo` when needed.
2. Add one shared host fixture in the style of the project's test framework.
3. Write scenarios for the requested endpoints. Assert the status code and the response body in every scenario.
4. Run `dotnet test` and fix failures until the suite passes.

## Using it

- **Claude Code**: paste the block into the repository's `CLAUDE.md`, or into a project skill, so it loads with every session.
- **Other agents**: put it in `AGENTS.md`, `.cursor/rules`, or the equivalent instructions file for the tool.
- **One-off tasks**: paste it at the top of the task description together with the endpoints you want covered.

Keep the block in sync with the Alba version you reference. It describes Alba 9; the [v9 changelog](https://github.com/JasperFx/alba/blob/master/v9_CHANGELOG.md)
lists every API that changed from Alba 8.
